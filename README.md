# Pikachu Wavefinding Project

This project is a navigation system designed to support blind and visually impaired individuals in navigating indoor public spaces such as galleries and lobbies. It was developed by students at Colorado College as part of a user-centered design course.

## Overview

The goal of the project is to enhance independence and accessibility using a simple, audio-based mobile app. Users receive step-by-step guidance through voice prompts and can access help with a single button.

## Features

- Screen reader-friendly interface
- Audio navigation to destinations like the Lane Family Gallery
- Help button for contacting staff
- Accessible layout and color contrast
- Lobby and gallery wayfinding support

## Design Process

We followed an iterative design process:
- **Research**: Collected user needs and challenges
- **Ideation**: Created an affinity diagram and initial sketches
- **Prototyping**: Designed user flows and developed a basic interface
- **Testing**: Validated with feedback and improved usability
